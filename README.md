I find it's too hard to learn how to build my own react boilerplate before Christmas break, so I had to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and changed it's production build folder to dist in a dodgy way from 'build' to 'dist'. I will try to change this later during the holiday.

Given more time I'll also add a listener for route change so as to import black bar in App component only, now I'm using it in 3 different components.
